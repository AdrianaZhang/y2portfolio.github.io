      &emsp;This Network Diagrams visualizes the social relationships between characters in the TV series My Brilliant
      Friend, including friendship, family, love,
      and work relationships. Simultaneously, I made three simplified diagrams in next three pages, which are the love
      relationship diagram of two heroines,
      the love relationship diagram of the love saint Nino, and the work relationship diagram of Naples, where the story
      mainly takes place.<br /><br />
      &emsp;The information of this diagram are collected from mainly two sources, the series itself and the fans
      community. Fans community like Fandom already
      organized some relationships and relationship analysis of main characters in table, but minor characters wasn’t
      recorded. Therefore most of information
      and photos are collected from series itself.<br /><br />
      &emsp;The social relationships between people are not single point to single point, but interlaced like a complex
      diagram. My brilliant Friend contains too
      many characters and plots, audiences may forget the relationship or the minor characters easily, it affects
      people's understanding of the plot(Ma and Yang, 2019). And charts as a simplifying tool for complex data can
      enhance people's memory (Mulrow, 2012).
      <br /><br />&emsp;In this diagram, nodes represent characters, and
      depending on the size of the nodes, its easy to determine the importance of the character in the story. And names
      under the nodes are characters’ first
      names, from the color of the name, the characters can be divided into different families at a glance. Besides,
      links represent relationships. The
      weighted links often represents the strength of the character's connection, and in this table, the strength of the
      connection is based not only on the
      emotional strength of the character, but also by the amount of space the presentation of the relationship takes up
      in the TV series. You can also see
      there are arrows on the links, some are double-headed and others just single headed. The one-way arrow in this
      diagram represents a one-way emotional
      connection, which can be unrequited love or one-sided hatred. According to the above, network diagram can clearly
      show many-to-many relationships in
      one time, and help audience understand and recall the characters and plots quickly.
