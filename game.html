      &emsp;Interactive documentaries are more fun than traditional videos, using interactive game options to neutralize
      the seriousness and educational nature of documentaries. I chose to make an interactive documentary about a day
      trip to hell precisely because I wanted to use the fun of interactive documentaries to dissolve the boring and
      dogmatic feeling of popular science. I use this format to explore the combination of Eastern culture and modern
      expression in this project.
      <br /><br />
      &emsp;The biggest advantage of the branching structure in this documentary is that it increases the audience's
      participation and freedom. By dividing the exploration into distinct areas, viewers can choose which scenes to
      engage with, minimizing fatigue from repetitive or uninteresting content. In a virtual world, immersion is
      stronger when users can influence the narrative, making the learning experience more memorable and effective
      (Ryan, 2015).
      <br /><br />
      &emsp;To tell this story, I primarily used an participatory mode. Although I cited historical documents common in
      expository documentaries, I focused more on engaging the audience through the interactive characters in Difu Tour,
      who are both narrators and participants in the story. These characters not only provide narrative, but also allow
      the audience to make choices that affect the direction of the story, thereby enhancing the overall immersion and
      participation (Nichols, 2010). However, the story unfolds under my subjective guidance. This approach maintains
      narrative coherence while fully reflecting interactivity, and strikes a balance between the two.
      <br /><br />
      &emsp;In addition, I also referenced some Poetic Mode and used some musical effects and visual language to shape
      the atmosphere of the documentary. For example, the soundtracks and screams of the Yellow Springs Road and the
      Trial of Becoming a Ghost can make the audience feel the frightening atmosphere; and I use warm and clean images
      when showing the Lookout and the festivals of the hell, while I use gloomy and blurred images at other times.
      <br /><br />
      &emsp;By combining these elements, the documentary balances entertainment and education, providing an engaging and
      memorable exploration of Eastern cultural themes in a modern, interactive format.
